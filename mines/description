You have a grid of covered squares, some of which contain mines, but you do not know which. Your job is to uncover every square which does not contain a mine. If you uncover a square containing a mine, you lose. If you uncover a square which does not contain a mine, you are told how many mines are contained within the eight surrounding squares.
This game needs no introduction. Popularised by Windows, it is perhaps the single best known desktop puzzle game in existence.
